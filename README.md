# OOOAW-Clone
This is my second school examination assignment where we use our newly gathered knowledge to create an event-site. The focus was to be able to create using HTML, CSS
and also some JQuery for different effects. I decided to create a clone of OOOAW.com with some personal tweaks to match the assignment.

This assignment has been very time consuming, it's a lot of code, and it has made me realize why different frameworks
was created. When you're working on your CSS for your fifth page you start to struggle keeping track of everything. I can only imagine how it was working on larger
projects back in the day.

I've learned a lot from this assignment only, but I've mostly learned that I've a lot more to learn and that it all comes down to practice. I've learnt that planning
before coding actually saves time, even though it's time consuming in itself and I regret I didn't do it in this project since I had to cut back on some designs because of it.

I want to give cred to Vincent Garreau (https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/) for his open source particle effect that I noticed original OOOAW.com was using.
